# Vim Learning Journal - 23 January, 2024

## Today's Focus:

Today marks the beginning of my journey to learn Vim. My main goal for today is 
to figure out how to get started and lay the groundwork for my learning path.

## Accomplishments:

- Explored online to figure out the books that I can follow.
- Finalized on the book **Learning the vi and Vim Editors, 7th Edition**.

## Challenges Faced:

- Difficulty in finding the **Learning the vi and Vim Editors, 8th Edition**.
- Unable to decide if there is a need to follow **Practical Vim** or/and 
**Modern Vim**.

## Insights Gained:

- Since **Learning the vi and Vim Editors**, is rich in history using it as the
starter will allow me to learn vim holistically
- Dividing the learning journey into two parts makes more sense, considering 
learning Vim is just for personal curiosity and learning depth of SQL will be
more valuable.

## Next Steps:

- Make a schedule with milestones
- Figure out how to incorporate vimtutor

*Overall, today's Vim learning session was thought provoking. I'm excited and 
looking forward to building the plan.*
